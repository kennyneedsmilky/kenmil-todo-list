## About this App

This is an app that is made by Kenneth and Miyuki Fullbright.

## -- Todo Features --

### ☆ Folder (Coming Soon)

In this feature, there will be a way to organize todos in seperate folders.

### ☆ Edit

Is there something that needs to be changed in your todo text? Don't worry! With the edit feature, it is possible to update the text in the todo.

### ☆ Done

Finished with a todo? By pressing the done button, the todo will stay in the todo's list without being deleted. This is good for times when one has to keep up with past events.

### ☆ Delete

Use this feature when the todo is finished and no longer needed. In a future update the deleted todo will go in a trash can. Since deleting things usually won't bring them back, there will be a pop up message that will ask to confirm the deletion.
